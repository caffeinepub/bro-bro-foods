  "summary": "Most requested functionality appears implemented: frontend quantity selection, live total calculation, minimum delivery rule with centralized constant, backend persistence of quantity/totalAmount, end-to-end wiring including WhatsApp message updates. One acceptance criterion (showing a minimum-order validation message in the form UI) is not clearly evidenced due to truncation. The diff also introduces an unrequested backend migration module and migration wiring.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-22",
      "requirement": "If the customer’s selection does not meet the minimum order rule, the \"Place Order\" action is blocked and an English validation message is shown explaining what is required.",
      "reason": "Blocking is evidenced via guard clauses and submit gating, but the diff snippet does not show any UI rendering of the English validation message when the minimum is not met (the helper is imported but its output is not shown in the truncated component).",
