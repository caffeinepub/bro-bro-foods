  "summary": "The diff implements an admin-only dashboard gated by a URL-hash token, adds backend support for order status + status-event timeline with an update API, adds admin UI hooks/actions for status updates plus list filters/sorting, and introduces separate customer/admin APK configuration with an admin-only download button. However, the admin order list does not clearly include UTR and paid date/time as required, and the order detail timeline display cannot be confirmed from the truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Admin order list must include (at minimum) UTR (if available) and paid date/time (if available) along with payment status.",
      "reason": "The implemented OrdersTable shows a payment badge and `paidVia` text but does not display `paymentConfirmation.utr` or `paymentConfirmation.paidAt` (paid date/time) in the list view.",

      "requirement": "Order detail view must show a chronological timeline including created time, each status change time, and payment confirmation time (when available).",
      "reason": "OrderDetailView is truncated before showing whether `statusEvents` and payment confirmation time are rendered as a readable chronological timeline; this cannot be verified from the provided diff.",

      "description": "Automatic periodic refresh (polling) of admin orders every 30 seconds.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not ask for polling/auto-refresh; it only requires orders to render and reflect status after refresh/reload.",
