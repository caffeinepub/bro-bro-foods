  "summary": "Diff adds a new PostOrderConfirmationModal and wires it into App.tsx to show a single post-order confirmation experience after successful backend order creation, including a Paytm QR image and a bill breakdown with a fixed ₹20 delivery charge and computed grand total. WhatsApp auto-open vs popup-blocked fallback appears to be handled via an optional whatsappLink prop in the same modal.",

      "reason": "The modal references an image path (/assets/generated/paytm-qr.dim_900x900.png), but the diff does not show the required image being added to the repository; without the asset, the QR may not actually render.",
