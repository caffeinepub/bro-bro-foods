  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented by adding an Owner Settings section to the admin dashboard and placing the existing AdsSettingsPanel within it. REQ-1 is likely implemented (public Ad Settings footer entry removed), but the provided App.tsx diff is truncated so evidence is indirect. REQ-3 is not evidenced: no implementation details show a PIN 7973 prompt/validation/error flow gating Owner/Ad Settings access for non-authorized users.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Password-protect access to “Ad Settings / Owner Settings” using PIN 7973, with a flow comparable to the existing Admin Login modal (prompt when not authorized; accept 7973; incorrect PIN shows English error; don’t reprompt within same session).",
      "reason": "The diff shows Owner Settings only being rendered inside AdminDashboard, but there is no evidence of a PIN 7973 prompt, validation logic, incorrect-PIN English error message, or session/state handling specific to unlocking Owner/Ad Settings. No changes to the admin login/PIN mechanism are shown in the provided modified/added files.",
