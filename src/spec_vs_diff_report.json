  "summary": "The diff does not show any concrete implementation of updating the Dilkhush founder photo assets or their usage in the app. Only a summary/metadata update is present, and that summary mentions many unrelated feature changes that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the Dilkhush founder photo so that the image shown under the \"Dilkhush\" card in the \"Meet the Owners\" section uses Photo #1, and ensure all other uses of the Dilkhush image constants (e.g., header avatar and About section) also show Photo #1, served as a static asset from frontend/public/assets/generated/ with no backend changes.",
      "reason": "No diff evidence shows changes to the actual image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated/ (512x512 and 128x128) or code updates to ensure all Dilkhush image usages point to those updated static assets. The only modified files shown are frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json, which are not the application code/assets themselves.",

      "reason": "These features are not requested by the BuildRequest (which only asks to swap Dilkhush photos). The only provided diff evidence is a change to a summary file claiming these modifications; no corresponding code diffs are shown to justify them.",
