# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Dilkhush founder photo to use Photo #1 consistently across the app.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Dilkhush image constants/asset references so the "Meet the Owners" Dilkhush card uses Photo #1 (car seated, black shirt).
- Ensure the same updated Dilkhush image is used everywhere that relies on the shared Dilkhush founder image constants (e.g., header avatar and About section).
- Keep the image served as a static frontend asset under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (no backend changes).

**User-visible outcome:** The Dilkhush founder photo appears as Photo #1 in the "Meet the Owners" section and anywhere else Dilkhush’s avatar/photo is shown (such as the header avatar and About section).
