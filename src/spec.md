# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add the provided hashtags to the website both as visible content and in HTML metadata for SEO.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a customer-facing “Hashtags” block/section that displays these hashtags exactly as provided: #budhladafastfood, #veg momos, #budhladabestmomos, #budhladabestrestaurant, #dilkhush, #devishhyadav (with any added label text in English).
- Update `frontend/index.html` metadata to include the same hashtags exactly as provided (e.g., in meta keywords and/or appended to the existing meta description) while keeping existing branding/title/description text intact.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can see a “Hashtags” section on the website showing the provided hashtags, and the site’s HTML metadata includes the same hashtags for discoverability.
